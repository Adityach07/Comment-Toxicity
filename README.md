# Comment Toxicity Classification

## Overview
The **Comment Toxicity Classification** project aims to develop a robust machine learning model capable of identifying and classifying toxic comments in online platforms. With the increasing prevalence of toxic language in digital interactions, there is a growing need for effective moderation tools to enhance user experience and safety.

This project employs advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, utilizing a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture to capture the context and nuances of comments. By training the model on a diverse dataset of labeled comments, the system can discern subtle differences in language, allowing it to accurately categorize comments as toxic or non-toxic.

### Objectives:
- **Improve Online Safety:** By identifying harmful comments, the project seeks to facilitate safer online interactions and reduce instances of harassment and bullying.
- **Enhance Content Moderation:** The model can serve as a tool for moderators on various platforms, enabling them to prioritize and address toxic content more efficiently.
- **Promote Healthy Discussions:** By filtering out toxic comments, the project aims to foster more constructive and respectful discussions within online communities.

### Approach:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a comprehensive dataset of comments, annotated for toxicity, to ensure the model learns from a wide range of examples.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data through tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization to improve model accuracy.
3. **Model Development:** Implement a BiLSTM model that utilizes embedding layers with pre-trained word vectors to capture contextual relationships in the comments.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness.

Through this project, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts in combating online toxicity and improving digital communication spaces.
